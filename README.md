# Snake

This is my implementation of the classic game of Snake, written in JavaScript for the browser.

Go [here](https://acrenwelge.github.io/Snake-JS-game) to play the game!

### Current Issues

* Sometimes behavior at the end of games is buggy - does not always reset properly
* The fruit may occasionally be placed in the tail of the snake

### Future Improvements

* User can set the snake speed before beginning the game
* User can set the size of the board
* User can change the color scheme
* High scores are tracked in a list below the board
